<p class="rebio">My name is Aaliyah Augustus, REALTOR with Novak Realty LLC. I am a twenty-four-year-old Baton Rouge native with a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition from Southern University A&M College. I am also a member of the Greater Baton Rouge Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors. I became a REALTOR because I am passion about serving others. Nothing is more rewarding than helping families and individuals achieve their goal of homeownership. During the homebuying process, a lot of information is given. So, it is my responsibility to keep buyers informed and educated as possible during the entire process.  My mission is to always act in the best interest of clients, exceed their expectations, and make the road to homeownership as easy as possible. </p>

<p class="tech">I'm current a student at Full Stack Academy, striving to obtain a certification in Web Development. It is a fast pace, 3 month program. It is far from easy, but I know it will be worth it. I started this program knowing nothing about developing. However, by the end of the program, I'm hoping to have enough experience to be a candidate for entry level jobs! I'm so excited to see where the skills I learn through this program will take me. </p>
